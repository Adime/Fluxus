FlashPunk is a free ActionScript library designed for developing 2D Flash games. Its goal is to provide you with a fast, clean framework for prototyping and developing games; this means most of the dirty work -- reliable framerate, sprite rendering/animation, player input, and collision detection (to name a few) -- has been covered with a set of base classes and functions for your ease of use. This gives you more time and energy to concentrate on the design and testing of your game. 

It''s important to note that FlashPunk is targeted towards the development of games with 2D raster/bitmap graphics, as opposed to vector graphics. It can manage thousands of animated bitmap sprites on-screen at a time without slowing, a lot faster than Flash normally could, because it operates under the assumption that your game primarily uses bitmapped graphics.

1. AS3Dmod is a cross-engine modifier library in AS3.

AS3Dmod is a library of modifiers for 3d objects. A modifier is an function used to modify a 3d object. Currently AS3Dmod contains 7 modifiers:

1. Bend - bends on object along an axis
1. Noise - deforms an object in a random manner
1. Skew - skews an object along one or more axes
1. Taper - [http://www.kxcad.net/autodesk/3ds_max/Autodesk_3ds_Max_9_Reference/taper_modifier.html](http://www.kxcad.net/autodesk/3ds_max/Autodesk_3ds_Max_9_Reference/taper_modifier.html)
1. Bloat - Bloats the mesh by forcing vertices out of specified sphere
1. Perlin - Generates a perlin noise bitmap and displaces vertices based on the color value of each pixel of the noise map
1. Twist - twists the mesh around it''s center point

AS3Dmod also features an abstract layer and a simple plug-in architecture that allows the modifiers to work with most of the popular Flash 3d engines.

Current version 0.2. Features include:

1. 7 modifiers as listed above
1. a framework for creating static and animated modifier stacks
1. 4 plug-ins for the most popular 3d engines: Pv3d, Away3d, Sandy3d and Alternativa3d
1. a simple demo for each engine

 In layman&#x27;s terms, Tweener helps you move things around on the screen using only code, instead of the timeline.

 The general idea of a tweening Class is that dynamic animation and transitions (created by code) are easier to maintain and control, and more stable than animation based on the regular Flash timeline, since you can control it by time rather than by frames.

 Aimed both for designers and advanced developers, the Tweener syntax is created with __simplicity__ of use in mind, while still allowing access to more advanced features. Because of this, it follows a&#x27;one-line&#x27; design mentality when creating new tweenings, with no instancing required (as it&#x27;s a static Class) and a set of optional parameters. Also, there are no initialization methods required by Tweener, other than the mandatory&#x27;import&#x27; command.

 Its fluid syntax allows it to be used to tween any numeric property of any object of any class, so it is not tied to specific properties of built-in Classes such as MovieClips or TextFields. This __flexibility__ grants a wider control on how transitions are performed, and makes creating complex sequential transitions on any kind of object easier.

 Small file overhead is also one of the main goals of Tweener - once included on SWF movies, Tweener currently takes 8.8kb (AS2 FL2), 9.2kb (AS2) or 10.4kb (AS3) of the total compiled file size. It can be compiled with the Flash IDE, MTASC, or Flex SDK (even with strict rules on), with no errors or warnings thrown during compilation.

 Tweener is also the spiritual successor to [MC Tween](http://hosted.zeh.com.br/mctween) . However, it follows ActionScript&#x27;s more strict OOP rules, and gets rid of the fixed parameter order syntax imposed by MC Tween. As a result, code written with Tweener is a lot more readable even for developers not versed on the Class.

 Development wise, __modularity__ is one of the main aspects of Tweener. The code is built in a way that new features such as transitions and special tweenings can be added (or removed) easily: for example, properties that are only acessible through methods and functions can be tweened by creating and registering new special properties. Expanding the feature set of the original Class can be done on a per-project basis, with no change to the original files.

# Intro

This project has the objective to host all as3 classes related to tweening. There will be 2 main focus:

# 1) ByteTween

Light weight engine (focusing in low Kb increase and not being a do-it-all engine).

## v1.3

Fixes some bugs from v1.2 that causes malfunction on large number of tweens. Adds new modules to the module list, they are the Gradients module. Added too the ShortTween wich is a shortcut for the most common tweens (x,y,alpha,...). Correction of bugs added some bytes to the basic version.

### Features

* Same as v1.2 and bug fixes.
* New modules! Added GradientRGB and GradientARGB (call for"gradientRGB"and"gradientARGB"respectively).
* ShortTween = static class with shortcut to most common tweens (alpha,x,y,...).



#### Modules Available

* __SimpleVersion(1.0Kb)__Actually not a Module. Just the ByteTween__without__overlap check,pause,unpause,cancel. Just the basic Numeric Tween. The smallest size the code will generate.
* __ColorModule(+0.4Kb)__Adds the&#x27;color&#x27; tween feature.
* __ControlModule(+0.2Kb)__Adds the&#x27;pause&#x27;,&#x27;unpause&#x27;,&#x27;cancel&#x27; functions to the engine.
* __FrameModule(+0.1Kb)__Adds the&#x27;frame&#x27; tween feature.
* __OverlapModule(+0.1Kb)__Adds the overlap check in the tween execution (remove older tweens of same property when a new one of same property arrives).
* __ScaleModule(+0.1Kb)__Adds the&#x27;scale&#x27; tween feature (tween both scaleX and scaleY).



#### New Modules

* __GradientRGB(+0.4Kb)__Given an Array of RGB uint values, tween all colors through time.
* __GradientARGB(+0.4Kb)__Given an Array of ARGB uint values, tween all colors (including alpha channel) through time.



#### ShortTween List

* x,y,position (both x/y),scaleX,scaleY,scale (both scaleX/Y),shrink (scale=0),expand (scale=1),alpha,fadeIn (alpha=1),fadeOut (alpha=-1),color,rotation,width,height.

__Usage:__

    //has_overlap: Flag that says if the engine will check overlap.
    //has_control: Flag that says if the engine can do pause,unpause,cancel actions.
    //... args: Adds 0 or more modules by just adding the module classes separated by commas.
    //Ex.: ByteTween.init(stage,true,true,OverlapModule,ControlModule,ColorModule);
    ByteTween.init(stage,has_overlap:Boolean,has_control:Boolean,... args);
    ByteTween.add(target:*, property:String,value:*,duration:Number,delay:Number, ease:Function,p_callback:Function,... arguments);
    
    //New ShortTween **some examples
    ShortTween.x(target:*,pos_x:Number,duration:Number,delay:Number, ease:Function,p_callback:Function,... arguments);
    ShortTween.alpha(target:*,alpha:Number,duration:Number,delay:Number, ease:Function,p_callback:Function,... arguments);
    //Same as alpha but tween directly to alpha=1.0
    ShortTween.fadeIn(target:*,duration:Number,delay:Number, ease:Function,p_callback:Function,... arguments);
    //Same as alpha but tween directly to alpha=-0.1
    ShortTween.fadeOut(target:*,duration:Number,delay:Number, ease:Function,p_callback:Function,... arguments);



## v1.2

Upgrade of version 1.1 with pratically same features. The difference is now the system can be configured by setting wich functionality module you want active on compile time. With this system you can setup from just a numeric tweener to the full functional tween engine with color,scale,... tweens. Well this is the most stable version. I think that new versions will come in form of modules but now I&#x27;m busy in finishing the MotionPack and new useful classes for ya!

### Features

* Same as v1.1 but now you can add/remove functionalities on compile time.
* Module System that permits to add the funcionality you want and control the size of your swf.
* Most simple version of ByteTween starts now with just__0.8Kb__!! Ok actually 885 bytes.. sorry..
* Functinonality Modules. Choose what you wan just insert it :)
* Even with all funcionalities inserted the max size that the code will achieve is__~2Kb__!!
* Alpha tween with visibility test is included in the basic package. Well it&#x27;s just a boolean check :)



## v1.1

First official version. v1.0 is a gold version :).

### Features

* __Ridiculous amount of Kb increase: Just 1.2Kb!__
* numeric properties tweening.
* &#x27;color&#x27;.

* Using ColorTransform.

* &#x27;alpha&#x27; with visibility control (negative alpha sets visible=false).
* &#x27;frame&#x27; tweening.
* &#x27;scale&#x27; tween.
* Both scaleX and Y at the same time.

* 21 easing functions + All Robert Penner&#x27;s classic functions.
* Tween pause,unpause,cancel control.
* Operation pointed by the target and its properties.

* Tween overlap control.
* A starting tween checks for older tweens of same property and cancel them).



# 2) MotionPack

Package of classes,events and interfaces that allows the developer not only to do the common tweening tasks (with the BaseTween class), but also develop its own tweening classes. It uses a Interface system that allow easy implementation and do not use the only"slot"of the"extends"keyword :).

# Easing Functions Expansion

Within the"org.thelab.motion.transition"package are the most common transitions used in tweens, and also the well known Robert Penner&#x27;s transition functions.But one can also implement its own tween functions.Both tween engines uses default functions for it. The template for them is:

    function ease_name(r:Number):Number;

Where the"r"parameter is a Number inside 0.0 ->1.0 range. Where 0.0 is the tween start and 1.0 is the tween end. The result of this function is used in the following equation:

    target[property] = initial_value + (delta_value)*ease_name(r);

 The result is a compact (~4Kb raw engine and ~9Kb with all plugins), highly optimized library, with a jQuery-like syntax.

  __Status:__ Beta stable, API may change slightly

  __Recent changes (rev.70):__

INSERT INTO "libraries" ("id","name","package","repository","created_at","updated_at","license","host","description","homepage","docs","tags","creator","summary","sourcepath") VALUES(128,'Actuate','svn','http://actuate.googlecode.com/svn/trunk','2010-06-17 23:18:25','2010-06-19 00:53:47','GNU General Public License v3','http://code.google.com','# Actuate is the best library for animating Flash AS3 projects [](#Actuate_is_the_best_library_for_animating_Flash_AS3_projects) 

### Actuate is faster than TweenLite and it is free for all your Flash projects. Power through your everyday needs using no-nonsense, lightweight tweens, then extend when you need more [](#Actuate_is_faster_than_and_it_is_free_for_all_your_Flash_project) 

 It&#x27;s simple to get started!

    Actuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } );
 Actuate is designed to be simple to use and to take advantage strong code completion support in code editors like FlashDevelop and Flex Builder, which means no more"reserved"keywords or"special"properties

    Actuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).onComplete (trace,"Hello World!");
 Instance-based tweens can be a pain. When you don&#x27;t keep track of each tween instance, you run the risk of creating conflicting tweens, which almost never turns out well. With first-class tween overwrite support, Actuate manages your tweens so you don&#x27;t have to. Actuate also makes it simple to disable overwriting when you need to sequence multiple animations

    Actuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } );
    Actuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 0 }, false).delay (1);
 It&#x27;s also easy to stop, pause or resume your tweens, too

    Actuate.stop (MySprite);
    Actuate.stop (MySprite,"alpha");
    Actuate.pause ();
    Actuate.pause (MySprite);
    Actuate.pause (MySprite, MyOtherSprite);
    Actuate.resume ();
    Actuate.resume (MySprite);
    Actuate.resume (MySprite, MyOtherSprite);
    Actuate.reset ();
 There also are additional shortcuts you can use to help you be even more productive. For example, you can use Actuate to create quick tween-based timers for sequencing events

    Actuate.timer (1).onComplete (trace,"Hello World!");
 Or you can use the"apply"method to stop conflicting tweens and instantly set an object&#x27;s properties

    Actuate.apply (MySprite, { alpha: 1 } );
## Advanced Features [](#Advanced_Features) 

 For advanced animations, you can also tween function calls instead of properties

    Actuate.update (customResize, 1, [100, 100], [300, 300]);
 Actuate also includes shortcuts for some special types of animation. Here is how you might apply a 50% tint using a color transform

    Actuate.transform (MySprite, 1).color (0xFF0000, 0.5);
 You can also control the volume and pan of a sound transform as well

    Actuate.transform (MySprite, 1).sound (0.5, 1);
    Actuate.transform (MySoundChannel, 1).sound (0.5, 1);
 You can also tween filters. You can reference the filter by its class, or by the value of its index in the filter array, whichever is easier

    Actuate.effects (MySprite, 1).filter (BlurFilter, { blurX: 10, blurY: 10 } );
 You even can create bezier curves, and complete motion paths, like in the Flash IDE. Chain multiple path commands together to create one solid path you can tween your objects across using the MotionPathActuator

    var xPath:MotionPath = MotionPath.bezier (200, 20).line (400);
    var yPath:MotionPath = MotionPath.bezier (0, 300).line (0);
    
    Actuate.motionPath (MySprite, 1, { x: xPath, y: yPath } );
## Tween Modifiers [](#Tween_Modifiers) 

 Each tween Actuate creates can be modified with many different tween modifiers. You can link tween modifiers to add delay, complete handlers, or configure many different options about the way your tween behaves

  __autoVisible__ 

    Actuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).autoVisible (false);
 Changing the visible property results in better performance than only an alpha of zero, so the autoVisible modifier toggles the visible property automatically based upon the alpha value of the target. It is enabled by default, but it can be disabled if you choose

  __delay__ 

    Actuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).delay (1);
 Controls how many seconds should pass before your animation begins

  __ease__ 

    Actuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).ease (Quad.easeOut);
 Defines a custom easing equation for your animation. Actuate includes many popular easing functions in both standard and optimized formats. The default is Expo.easeOut, but you can change the default equation through Actuate.defaultEase

  __onComplete__ 

    Actuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).onComplete (trace,"Tween finished");
 Calls a function when the tween is finished. You can also define parameters to be used when calling the function

  __onUpdate__ 

    Actuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).onUpdate (trace,"Tween updated");
 Calls a function every time the tween updates. You can also define parameters to be used when calling the function

  __reflect__ 

    Actuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).repeat ().reflect ();
 Automatically reverses the animation every other time it is repeated. You must enable repeat in order to see any effect

  __repeat__ 

    Actuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).repeat (10);
 Runs your animation multiple times before it finishes. You can make your tween repeat indefinitely by passing no value, or you can define the number of times it should repeat

  __reverse__ 

    Actuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).reverse ();
 Reverses the direction of your tween

  __smartRotation__ 

    Actuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { rotation: 180 } ).smartRotation ();
 Rotation is circular, so it can be strange to animate. What should be positive one moment is negative the next. As a result, treating rotation like a standard tween will result in jerking once the signs change. Smart rotation always applies rotation in the nearest direction, alleviating this issue.

  __snapping__ 

    Actuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).snapping ();
 Rounds all of your tween values

BulkLoader takes a more dynamic, less architecture heavy aproach. Few imports and making heavy use of AS3&#x27;s dynamic capabilities, BulkLoader has a one-liner feel that doesn&#x27;t get in your way.

 BulkLoader hides the complexity of loading different data types in AS3 and provides a unified interface for loading, accessing and events notification for different types of content.

 This library is licensed under an open source MIT license. Features:

* Connection pooling.
* Unified interface for different loading types.
* Unified progress notification.
* Events for individual items and as groups.
* Priority
* Stop and resuming individually as well as in bulk.
* Cache management.
* Statistics about loading (latency, speed, average speed).
* Various kinds on progress indication: ratio (items loaded / items to load), bytes , and weighted percentage.
* Configurable number of retries.
* Configurable logging.
* Various assest types (XML, NetStreams, Swfs, Images, Sound, Text Files)

 Design goals:

* Minimal imports.
* Few method to learn.
* Consistent interface, regardless of content type.

 BulkLoader gracefully handles progress notification in these use cases:

* Few connections to open: bytes total can be used instantly.
* Many connections opened: progress by ratio
* Many connections opened for data of widely varying sizes: progress by weight.

 The target of the Masapi is to provide a complete framework dedicated to the management of the massive loading into a flash/flex application. It is designed to be as easy as possible to use but also to be as flexible as possible.

 There are the main features that the framework supports :

* Same interface for all load managers (URLLoader, Loader, ...)
* Easy massive loading classes
* Advanced massive loading (priority, dependencies)
* Advanced massive loading management (loading policy, loading information, ...)

I had to reinvent the wheel (sorry guyz :p) to fit my devt needs and code design vision.

  __What is AS-HIVE?__ 

 AS-HIVE allows developers to rapidly build applications and games that rely on state, event, and load management of external media files.

 We&#x27;d like to foster a collective of creative people who design and develop primarily using Adobe&#x27;s Flash. We encourage input and participation from all ranges of people who code in Actionscript.

 Hard core developers may be interested to know that AS-HIVE is built on a state-based MVC framework but you don&#x27;t have to be a hard core developer to use it.

 Intermediate developers who don&#x27;t wish to advance the framework can try the samples so that one can see how to save time and energy allowing AS-HIVE to handle loading your external assets like xml, pngs, flvs and mp3s. AS-HIVE also helps you animate screens by creating sequences that build up and tear down before moving to the next state.

 By integrating other open source projects like Tweener and Papervision3D, AS-HIVE offers a robust and reliable mechanism for manipulating 2D and 3D content allowing the developer to focus on architecture and flow.

  __How do I learn about AS-HIVE?__ 

 The best way to learn HIVE is to ask a lot of questions and [join our discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/as-hive) .

 Jovan has launched [buckup.ca](http://www.buckup.ca) and is working on some cool new features within his branch which we hope to bring into the 0.3 release later this spring.

 Although we&#x27;re big fans of Tweener, we&#x27;re also contemplating opening the LayoutManager up to other tween libraries like Tweenlite, Tweensy, and gTween so that they work like other plug-ins and can choose which ever Tween library you like best; possibly even mix and match.

 Peter is working on telnet project. Check out [flashterm](http://www.flashterm.com) . Read [his blog post](http://www.peternitsch.net/blog/?p=84) 

  *Jan 15, 2009* 

 spring cleaning time! we realize that this site isn&#x27;t as easy to use and learn from as say a site like jquery.com which is so compelling as it bridges motion on the desktop and mobile. Of course the Flash 10 player will be on Android soon, and AS-HIVE is great fit for Flash 10! So we have some work to do this year to catch up to sites like jquery.

 We will add the missing hello world demo and attempt to better introduce the framework.

 Pete has finished his work on the new plug-in manager, and you can grab it from the featured downloads or the SVN (Source page).

 If you need a copy of the AS3 Webservice package by Carlo Alducente you can get it from the featured downloads.

  *Jan 8, 2008* 

 Pete has started to update HIVE to [give us plug-in support](http://www.peternitsch.net/blog/?p=19) so that we can swap out libraries as needed. For instance, if we wanted to play with different branches of PV3D we will soon be able to use the effects or GreatWhite 2.0 libraries depending on what we want to do in each state.

 UPDATED 09.23.09: Currently releasing Fosfr .9 nightly builds, these are growing very stable and .9 is a few days of stability testing away now. Fosfr .8 is still available in the downloads section for now, a new example site built on .9 will be built once .9 is final. See the wiki doc [fosfrNightlyBuilds](/p/fosfr/wiki/fosfrNightlyBuilds) for limited info on where to begin with implementing this preview release. Preliminary documentation (still in the works) is available at: [http://www.jeffdepascale.com/documentation/fosfrPreRelease/](http://www.jeffdepascale.com/documentation/fosfrPreRelease/) 

 Info on .9: See [nextRelease](/p/fosfr/wiki/nextRelease) doc in wiki. Pushing towards a final 1.0 release, and the change list is long and growing, but the vast majority is tied to overhauling existing functionality to make the framework more digestable and all around useful and adding the last pieces of wish list functionalities before locking down to bug fixes, which will begin after this release through 1.0.

 Some of the bigger featues of .9 BETA (anticipated final release by 11/15):

 -Fosfr is now implemented using the provided SWC files and the included SWF library file (the com folder is still provided for reference). see the guide [SWCImplementationGuide](/p/fosfr/wiki/SWCImplementationGuide) for information. This reduces the framework footprint to 13kb on initial load, a library load of 27kb (pulled automatically in the initial preload), and 4kb for all other framework files. This means substantially reduced load times, much faster compile times (since SWC files are precompiled into bytecode) and initial preloader graphics appear very quickly with only 13kb of overhead on initial load.

 The Notifier panel as of Fosfr .9 build 120 (showing optional extended information):
 ![](http://www.jeffdepascale.com/images/notifierGrab.jpg) 

 -Notifier (formerly debug) - Error trapping, variable panel size, ability to prioritize debug messaging, player info, garbage collection forcing (debug layers only), real time property inspectors, and an optional visual error beacon for trapped errors.

 -Notifier additionally now features a code injection system; see [codeInjection](/p/fosfr/wiki/codeInjection) for details on valid expressions. Adding functionality to this on an ongoing basis right now.

 -A new sound controller

 -overhaul of loader event notifications

 -overhaul of how external classes are handled in the framework; much tighter integration all around.

 -utilization of a custom namespace to close some of the open holes in the framework.

 Check out the [nextRelease](/p/fosfr/wiki/nextRelease) doc in the wiki for the full revision list.

 NOTE - .8 beta was released with an outdated version of swfaddress. please download the latest version at: [http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/](http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/) This will be addressed in the .9 release.

 Updated 5.18.09 - Current release: .8 BETA

 A complete framework for AS3 site development, Fosfr simplies building full sites designed with a master SWF and multiple sub SWF format. Fosfr handles debugging, tracking, setting up site navigation, loading and unloading sub pages, automatic preloading (via Prequel), SWFAddress handling, simple access to Flashvars, query string params, and cookies, and does it all from implementations as simple as two lines of code per document class. Comes with a complete set of base classes for simple access to all of the methods and features of Fosfr right at Document class level, and optionally can run from a single configuration xml file for ease of access to site parameters without the need to recompile. FosfrLite (included), a streamlined version of Fosfr, provides access to the various pieces of Fosfr without the navigation package for loading sub SWF&#x27;s.

 The current release of Fosfr is packaged with SWFAddress 2.2 ( [http://www.asual.com/swfaddress](http://www.asual.com/swfaddress) ) and Prequel 1.0 ( [http://code.google.com/p/prequel-preloader](http://code.google.com/p/prequel-preloader) )

 The new ActionScript 3.0 Client Library for Facebook Platform API, fully supported by Facebook and Adobe, makes it easy to build applications that combine the strengths of the Flash Platform and Facebook Platform.

 The Adobe Flash Platform and Facebook Platform provide the ideal solution for building rich, social experiences on the web. Flash is available on more than 98% of Internet-connected PCs, so people can immediately access the applications, content, and video that enable social interactions. The Facebook Platform is used by millions of people everyday to connect and share with the people in their lives. Together, both platforms allow you to:

* Share: Create rich interactions for users to share with friends.
* Have fun: Make games social; let users compete against their friends.
* Connect: Let users connect to your RIAs with Facebook Connect.
* Solve problems: Build RIAs that harness the power of community.
* Reach people: Reach millions of Facebook users through social distribution.

### Getting Started [](#Getting_Started) 

 For tutorials, articles, and videos on using the new API, visit the [Facebook page](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/facebook/) on the Adobe Developer Center. You can also see the [docs](http://facebook-actionscript-api.googlecode.com/svn/release/current/docs/index.html) for the most recent and stable build.

### Project History [](#Project_History) 

 The API was originally developed by [Jason Crist](http://pbking.com/) and authored under the direction of [Terralever](http://terralever.com/) , an online marketing firm with strength in Flash-based media. Although Adobe has taken over day-to-day management of the project, Jason still maintains a consulting role. Under the direction of Adobe, the highly experienced team of Flash and Flex experts from [gskinner.com](http://www.gskinner.com) have developed and architected the latest iteration of the API.

 If you are looking for the deprecated code and samples, see the&#x27;tag/version2&#x27; directory in the repository or search for files with the&#x27;Deprecated&#x27; tag in the downloads section.

 Flash Camo (for short) is a graphics framework that allows AS 3 applications to be easily skinned from pngs, jpgs, or gifs. The framework is broken down into 3 core areas: Decals, the CSS Parser, and the [CamoDisplay](/p/flash-camouflage/wiki/CamoDisplay) . These systems can be used individually or combined to fit your needs. When used together they form a powerful set of tools to help skin and style any Flash application. With Camo’s modular approach, you can use as little or as much of the framework as you want. The entire framework is under 35k.

 Flash Camo is open source (under the MIT License), is compatible with FlashPlayer 9/10, Flex 3, and AIR. It can be built with the open source Flex SKD compiler or used in Flash CS 3/4 as a swc.

  __I have created a new Google Group to help answer questions about the framework and start open discussions on tips, tricks, and problems. Check it out here [http://groups.google.com/group/flash-camouflage](http://groups.google.com/group/flash-camouflage) __

  __Camo, v2.1 has just been released along with cleanups to the svn repo. If you had checked out the Camo from the trunk before please recheck out the entire trunk since it is up to date with 2.1.

  __Coordy is a light Actionscript 3 layout framework which offers a simple way to organize DisplayObjects into various different 2d and 3d layouts. The layouts are light, powerful and virtual organizers that simply manage x/y/z coordinates of DisplayObjects - meaning your objects are not tightly bound to any specific layout.__ 

### Update (December 1, 2009) [](#Update_(December_1,_2009)) 

 coordy 0.9.9 is officially released. All sorts of changes have been made which could potentially cause problems with any code using 0.9.1 or lower. I will be writing up some documentation on changes in the latest version, until then, you can check out all the fun new stuff [here](http://somerandomdude.com/projects/coordy/) .

### Update (November 15, 2009) [](#Update_(November_15,_2009)) 

 coordy just went through a __huge__ rewrite and is quite different in many ways. I have updated the source in SVN, but the ZIP download still offers up the 0.9.1 version. The examples and documentation have been updated in the SVN repo if you want to give it a try. I will be posting extensive notes on the changes and how to best use the library in the days to come.

### Update (August 20, 2009) [](#Update_(August_20,_2009)) 

 coordy 0.9.1 was just committed and available to use. Layouts in coordy 0.9.1 now have the ability to export their layout properties as either a JSON string or an XML object. Have a look at the [documentation](http://sweatshop.somerandomdude.com/projects/coordy/docs) for more details.

# Support This Project [](#Support_This_Project) 

 coordy is completely free to use and will always be that way. That said, this code takes time to write and test. Please [ __support this project__ ](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=8307931) by giving whatever you feel is appropriate - it will help ease the burden of continuing to push this project forward.

# Getting Started [](#Getting_Started) 

 Get to know this framework by checking out some [examples](http://sweatshop.somerandomdude.com/projects/coordy/examples.html) and the library&#x27;s [documentation](http://sweatshop.somerandomdude.com/projects/coordy/docs/) . The examples provided give a sense of the basic mechanisms and process for setting up layouts, updating layouts and managing multiple layouts. __Source code to the examples are also available on the examples page__ . I suggest checking out the [source via SVN](http://coordy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/) as that will be updated much more frequently than the static zip.

# How Does It Work? [](#How_Does_It_Work?) 

 The basic explanation of how coordy works is once a DisplayObject is added to a layout, a node instance is created which points to the DisplayObject. The node is the link between the layout and DisplayObject. The node contains all the coordinate information for that DisplayObject, so that even if a DisplayObject is moved, the coordinate information for it persists due to its corresponding node. This is why the DisplayObject can belong to an infinite amount of layouts, because the layout merely handles its created node objects which, in turn, have a link to the DisplayObject.

 Layouts are merely abstract organizers, they do not need to be added/removed from the stage. Nonetheless, they have tweenable properties such as x, y, z, width, height, depth etc. When a display property such as width is altered, the layout adjusts all the cells and the nodes’s links to fit in the layout’s new dimension. This allows you to “tween” a layout even though it does not truly exist on the stage.

 Layouts will also adapt when nodes/DislpayObjects are removed from the layout. This allows simple motion-based layout management capabilities.

# What Type of Layouts Does coordy Have? [](#What_Type_of_Layouts_Does_coordy_Have?) 

### Here&#x27;s the full list, there should be more to come in the near future. [](#Here&#x27;s_the_full_list,_there_should_be_more_to_come_in_the_n) 

  __2d Layouts__ 

1. Ellipse - Distributes nodes in a simple ellipse
1. Flow - Attempts to fit all nodes within the bounds of the layout&#x27;s target
1. Grid - Distributes nodes in a basic 2d grid
1. HorizontalLine - Distributes nodes in a horizontal line
1. Lattice - Similar to a grid, but more flexible and feature-rich
1. Scatter - Distributes nodes randomly
1. Snapshot - Records the x,y coordinates of all nodes
1. Stack - Distributes nodes in an ordered stack
1. VerticalLine - Distributes nodes in a vertical line
1. Wave - Distributes nodes in a wave (i.e. sine, cosine, etc.)

  __3d Layouts__ 

1. Ellipse3d - Distributes nodes in a 3d ellipse (good for carousels)
1. Grid3d - Distributes nodes in a 3d grid
1. Scatter3d - Distributes nodes randomly in all three axes
1. Snapshot3d - Records the x,y,z coordinates of all nodes
1. Spheroid3d - Distributes nodes in a spheroid
1. Stack3d - Distributes nodes in an ordered 3d stack
1. Wave3d - Distributes nodes in a 3d wave (i.e. sine, cosine, etc.)
1. WaveEllipse3d - Still in testing, does funky stuff

* WiiFlash Server
* WiiFlash ActionScript API

## Downloading [](#Downloading) 

 We suggest you to use an SVN client like [tortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) or [subclipse](http://subclipse.tigris.org/) (with FlexBuilder 2) to download the WiiFlash source code instad of using the featured wiiflash_api.zip. This way you stay always up-to-date. Since people have often problems with downloading from a repository we put the file up there for users that do not want to deal with SVN. If you like to use SVN and the help on Google Code is not enough for you there is also an [article](http://wiki.papervision3d.org/index.php?title=Download_from_SVN) in the [Papervision3D wiki](http://wiki.papervision3d.org/) about this issue.

## API [](#API) 

 WiiFlash is very easy to use. You can connect a Wiimote in Flash with three lines of code and start reading your data.

    var wiimote: Wiimote = new Wiimote();
    wiimote.addEventListener( Event.CONNECT, onWiimoteConnect );
    wiimote.connect();
 We also support the new DOM event model of Flash. For people that are bored of all the listeners we have simple boolean flags too.

Data is stored as SWF bytecode (you can&#x27;t get more native than that on the Flash Platform) that is interpreted by the Flash Player.

 With ActionScript 3 support, SWX provides you with custom events which are dispatched when your data is received, and it is available for use immediately. Using ActionScript 2, you can loadMovie() SWX data files and they are ready to use the moment they are loaded. When using either language you don&#x27;t need to deserialize or massage the data in any way before using it as it is stored in native Flash objects.

# Introduction [](#Introduction) 

 As3 RPC lib is a set of libraries that can be used with Flex 2 or AS 3 to invoke remote procedure calls using:

* AMF0 (Flash Remoting MX)
* XML-RPC
* JSON-RPC (Coming Soon)

 Usage mimics the RemoteObject which is available natively in [Flex 2](http://livedocs.macromedia.com/flex/2/langref/) in an effort to make usage in existing frameworks (e.g. Cairngorm) and design pattern (e.g. Token pattern) easy as possible.

# Updates 4/16/2008 [](#Updates_4/16/2008) 

* Fixed date format
* Change content-type header to text/xml
* Fixed binary data decoding
* Added encoding of generic objects
* Added ability to overwrite serializer

# Updates 4/14/2007 [](#Updates_4/14/2007) 

* Fixed show busy cursor
* Fixed untyped object returning null issue

# Updates 2/25/2007 [](#Updates_2/25/2007) 

* Added preliminary JSON support
* Added manifest to swc to allow for easier namespace declaration e.g.xmlns:ak33m=&#x27;http://ak33m.com/mxml&#x27;
* Fixed XMLRPC missing double deserialazation

*  [Working with gradients.](http://code.google.com/p/mojocolors/wiki/GradientTutorial) 

 Mojocolors allows you to work with color in Actionscript in a very natural way, for example by using HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) for color manipulation. You can work with one color (ch.badmojo.color.Color) or with a whole list of colors (ch.badmojo.color.ColorWheel). Color theory / harmony rules, different shades of the same color, sorting by brightness or hue or saturation, creation of gradients and much more are implemented, so you can focus on writing better apps.

## Color Harmony: [](#Color_Harmony:) 

 Apply the color theory you learned in school and create nicer colors without switching between Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator or Kuler to get the Hex values of your colors.

## Color Shades: [](#Color_Shades:) 

 An easy way to create colors of the same hue without coding too much. just writevar wheel : ColorWheel = new Color(230,0,60).toWarm(30);to get some warm color variations of your color.

ASBlender is an Actionscript 3 library to read [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) .blend files.

See [blender-file-format](http://www.blender.org/development/architecture/blender-file-format/) for an explanation of the .blend format.

The .blend format contains all C-structures used, which are defined in the so called DNA. This way .blend files are fully backward compatible.
[Check out the DNA of a Blender 2.48 .blend](http://www.atmind.nl/blender/blender-sdna.html).

ASBlender simply maps these structures to AS3 Object''s. This means there are no "blender" classes like "BlenderScene" in this library. Everything is an `Object`, `Array`, `Number`, `int` or `String`.

This means that using this library requires some basic knowledge on the inner workings of [Blender](http://www.blender.org/). So the learning curve can be rather steep. Its up to you to do something with the data. ASBlender simply provides you the .blend data.

But if your goal is to import simple .blend''s containing a single mesh, the examples below should get you going pretty fast.

See:

* [Main.as](http://github.com/timknip/asblender/blob/master/src/Main.as) for a simple implementation.
* [PapervisionTest.as](http://github.com/timknip/asblender/blob/papervision3d/src/PapervisionTest.as) for a simple Papervision implementation. See the [compiled swf here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/438592/blender/PapervisionTest.swf).

Hello World:

* First you need the create a `ByteArray` by loading a .blend file or by using `[Embed]`.
* Create a BlendFile object: `var blend:BlendFile = new BlendFile();`
* And read it: `blend.read( theByteArray );`

All scenes in the .blend are read by default, you can access the scenes contained in the .blend thru `var scenes:Array = blend.scenes`. 
Blender can contain more then one [Scene](http://www.atmind.nl/blender/blender-sdna.html#struct:Scene), but its likely there''s only one.

Of course you can access other structures like [IpoCurve](http://www.atmind.nl/blender/blender-sdna.html#struct:IpoCurve), [Panel](http://www.atmind.nl/blender/blender-sdna.html#struct:Panel), [Lamp](http://www.atmind.nl/blender/blender-sdna.html#struct:Lamp), etc. too. Use for example `var curves:Array = blend.readType(theByteArray, "IpoCurve");` to read all curves.

Note that I''m still learning how all these structures stick together. More example code will follow as my knowledge increases.

The library has not been optimized for speed, and those numbers could probably be improved.You can [browse the source](http://crypto.hurlant.com/demo/srcview/) , [download the source](http://as3crypto.googlecode.com/files/Crypto.zip) or [download the SWC binary](http://as3crypto.googlecode.com/files/as3crypto.swc) Check out the [release notes](http://as3crypto.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/as3crypto/RELEASENOTES.txt) for a bit more details.Things that should make it in the next release:

* better ASN-1 parsing
* SSL 3.0 support
* various bugfixes (Socket, BigInteger)

# ARTionscript is an AS3&#x27;Generative Art&#x27; Framework



## Aim

The aim of this project is to decrease the barrier to entry as well as openly share code an algorithms relating to generative art.

## Concept

Conceptually there is a&#x27;Studio&#x27; (Main/Document Class) which has access to&#x27;Artists&#x27; (algorithms / rules). The&#x27;Artist&#x27; is given a&#x27;Canvas&#x27; (a glorified Sprite), can be given some&#x27;Inspiration&#x27; (eg. a Flickr image / sound file) and a&#x27;Palette&#x27; (eg. a Kuler colour theme).The&#x27;Artist&#x27; then creates the art work on and to the dimensions of&#x27;Canvas&#x27;. The resulting artwork is created using his own internal algorithms, which is influenced by the&#x27;Inspiration&#x27; and painted in colours of the&#x27;Palette&#x27; given to him.You can request the&#x27;Artist&#x27; retry by pressing the Keyboard.SPACE or alternatively you can export the artwork as a bitmap using&#x27;ctrlKey + S&#x27;.

## Contributing

*The code here is not perfect and we don&#x27;t expect yours to be either.*So... write some code, create something crazy, rework another&#x27;Artist&#x27;, team up with others, but most importantly__share it__!
