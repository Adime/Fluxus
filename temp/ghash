AS3Dmod is a library of modifiers for 3d objects. A modifier is an function used to modify a 3d object. Currently AS3Dmod contains 7 modifiers:\n\n# Bend - bends on object along an axis\n# Noise - deforms an object in a random manner\n# Skew - skews an object along one or more axes\n# Taper - \"http://www.kxcad.net/autodesk/3ds_max/Autodesk_3ds_Max_9_Reference/taper_modifier.html\":http://www.kxcad.net/autodesk/3ds_max/Autodesk_3ds_Max_9_Reference/taper_modifier.html \n# Bloat - Bloats the mesh by forcing vertices out of specified sphere\n# Perlin - Generates a perlin noise bitmap and displaces vertices based on the color value of each pixel of the noise map\n# Twist - twists the mesh around it&#x27;s center point\n\np. AS3Dmod also features an abstract layer and a simple plug-in architecture that allows the modifiers to work with most of the popular Flash 3d engines.\n\np. Current version 0.2. Features include:\n\n# 7 modifiers as listed above\n# a framework for creating static and animated modifier stacks\n# 4 plug-ins for the most popular 3d engines: Pv3d, Away3d, Sandy3d and Alternativa3d\n# a simple demo for each engine\n\np.

   "p. Tweener (caurina.transitions.Tweener) is a Class used to create tweenings and other transitions via ActionScript code for projects built on the Flash platform. It&#x27;s released and maintained for these versions:\n\n* ActionScript 2.0, for Flash 7+ and Flash Lite 2.0+\n* ActionScript 2.0, for Flash 8+\n* ActionSctipt 3.0, for Flash 9+\n\np. Ported versions for other languages are also available:\n\n*  \"haXe version\":http://www.ralcr.com/caurina/ (ported by \"Baluta Cristian\":http://www.ralcr.com/ )\n*  \"JavaScript version\":http://coderepos.org/share/wiki/JSTweener (ported by \"Yuichi Tateno\":http://d.hatena.ne.jp/secondlife )\n*  \"JavaScript version\":http://mikemacmillan.com/tweener/ (ported by \"Michael MacMillan\":http://mikemacmillan.com )\n*  \"vvvv version\":http://code.google.com/p/tweener/downloads/list?q=label:Platform-vvvv using nodes\n*  \"vvvv version\":http://vvvv.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vvvv/plugins/c%23/Value/TweenerShaper/trunk/ using a native C# dll (faster) (ported by by Rene Westhof)\n*  \"Python version\":http://wiki.python-ogre.org/index.php/CodeSnippits_pyTweener (ported by Benjamin Harling)\n*  \"C++ version\":http://code.google.com/p/cpptweener/ (ported by \"Wesley Marques\":http://codevein.com/ )\n\np. There are also some other libraries inspired by it:\n\n*  \"Artefact Animator\":http://artefactanimator.codeplex.com/ for Silverlight/WPF (by \"Jesse Graupmann\":http://www.jessegraupmann.com/ , among others)\n\np. In layman&#x27;s terms, Tweener helps you move things around on the screen using only code, instead of the timeline.\n\np. The general idea of a tweening Class is that dynamic animation and transitions (created by code) are easier to maintain and control, and more stable than animation based on the regular Flash timeline, since you can control it by time rather than by frames.\n\np. Aimed both for designers and advanced developers, the Tweener syntax is created with *simplicity* of use in mind, while still allowing access to more advanced features. Because of this, it follows a&#x27;one-line&#x27; design mentality when creating new tweenings, with no instancing required (as it&#x27;s a static Class) and a set of optional parameters. Also, there are no initialization methods required by Tweener, other than the mandatory&#x27;import&#x27; command.\n\np. Its fluid syntax allows it to be used to tween any numeric property of any object of any class, so it is not tied to specific properties of built-in Classes such as MovieClips or TextFields. This *flexibility* grants a wider control on how transitions are performed, and makes creating complex sequential transitions on any kind of object easier.\n\np. Small file overhead is also one of the main goals of Tweener - once included on SWF movies, Tweener currently takes 8.8kb (AS2 FL2), 9.2kb (AS2) or 10.4kb (AS3) of the total compiled file size. It can be compiled with the Flash IDE, MTASC, or Flex SDK (even with strict rules on), with no errors or warnings thrown during compilation.\n\np. Tweener is also the spiritual successor to \"MC Tween\":http://hosted.zeh.com.br/mctween . However, it follows ActionScript&#x27;s more strict OOP rules, and gets rid of the fixed parameter order syntax imposed by MC Tween. As a result, code written with Tweener is a lot more readable even for developers not versed on the Class.\n\np. Development wise, *modularity* is one of the main aspects of Tweener. The code is built in a way that new features such as transitions and special tweenings can be added (or removed) easily: for example, properties that are only acessible through methods and functions can be tweened by creating and registering new special properties. Expanding the feature set of the original Class can be done on a per-project basis, with no change to the original files.\n\np.

   "p.  \" !http://thelaborat.org/img/code_google_title.jpg! \":http://thelaborat.org/ \n\nh1. Intro \"\":#Intro \n\np. This project has the objective to host all as3 classes related to tweening. There will be 2 main focus:\n\nh1. 1) ByteTween \"\":#1) \n\np. Light weight engine (focusing in low Kb increase and not being a do-it-all engine).\n\nh2. v1.3 \"\":#v1.3 \n\np. Fixes some bugs from v1.2 that causes malfunction on large number of tweens. Adds new modules to the module list, they are the Gradients module. Added too the ShortTween wich is a shortcut for the most common tweens (x,y,alpha,...). Correction of bugs added some bytes to the basic version.\n\nh3. Features \"\":#Features \n\n* Same as v1.2 and bug fixes.\n* New modules! Added GradientRGB and GradientARGB (call for\"gradientRGB\"and\"gradientARGB\"respectively).\n* ShortTween = static class with shortcut to most common tweens (alpha,x,y,...).\n\nh4. Modules Available \"\":#Modules_Available \n\n*  *SimpleVersion(1.0Kb)* Actually not a Module. Just the ByteTween *without* overlap check,pause,unpause,cancel. Just the basic Numeric Tween. The smallest size the code will generate.\n*  *ColorModule(+0.4Kb)* Adds the&#x27;color&#x27; tween feature.\n*  *ControlModule(+0.2Kb)* Adds the&#x27;pause&#x27;,&#x27;unpause&#x27;,&#x27;cancel&#x27; functions to the engine.\n*  *FrameModule(+0.1Kb)* Adds the&#x27;frame&#x27; tween feature.\n*  *OverlapModule(+0.1Kb)* Adds the overlap check in the tween execution (remove older tweens of same property when a new one of same property arrives).\n*  *ScaleModule(+0.1Kb)* Adds the&#x27;scale&#x27; tween feature (tween both scaleX and scaleY).\n\nh4. New Modules \"\":#New_Modules \n\n*  *GradientRGB(+0.4Kb)* Given an Array of RGB uint values, tween all colors through time.\n*  *GradientARGB(+0.4Kb)* Given an Array of ARGB uint values, tween all colors (including alpha channel) through time.\n\nh4. ShortTween List \"\":#List \n\n* x,y,position (both x/y),scaleX,scaleY,scale (both scaleX/Y),shrink (scale=0),expand (scale=1),alpha,fadeIn (alpha=1),fadeOut (alpha=-1),color,rotation,width,height.\n\np.  *Usage:* \n\n//has_overlap: Flag that says if the engine will check overlap. //has_control: Flag that says if the engine can do pause,unpause,cancel actions. //... args: Adds 0 or more modules by just adding the module classes separated by commas. //Ex.: ByteTween.init(stage,true,true,OverlapModule,ControlModule,ColorModule); ByteTween.init(stage,has_overlap:Boolean,has_control:Boolean,... args); ByteTween.add(target:*, property:String,value:*,duration:Number,delay:Number, ease:Function,p_callback:Function,... arguments); //New ShortTween **some examples ShortTween.x(target:*,pos_x:Number,duration:Number,delay:Number, ease:Function,p_callback:Function,... arguments); ShortTween.alpha(target:*,alpha:Number,duration:Number,delay:Number, ease:Function,p_callback:Function,... arguments); //Same as alpha but tween directly to alpha=1.0 ShortTween.fadeIn(target:*,duration:Number,delay:Number, ease:Function,p_callback:Function,... arguments); //Same as alpha but tween directly to alpha=-0.1 ShortTween.fadeOut(target:*,duration:Number,delay:Number, ease:Function,p_callback:Function,... arguments);h2. v1.2 \"\":#v1.2 \n\np. Upgrade of version 1.1 with pratically same features. The difference is now the system can be configured by setting wich functionality module you want active on compile time. With this system you can setup from just a numeric tweener to the full functional tween engine with color,scale,... tweens. Well this is the most stable version. I think that new versions will come in form of modules but now I&#x27;m busy in finishing the MotionPack and new useful classes for ya!\n\nh3. Features \"\":#Features \n\n* Same as v1.1 but now you can add/remove functionalities on compile time.\n* Module System that permits to add the funcionality you want and control the size of your swf.\n* Most simple version of ByteTween starts now with just *0.8Kb* !! Ok actually 885 bytes.. sorry..\n* Functinonality Modules. Choose what you wan just insert it :)\n* Even with all funcionalities inserted the max size that the code will achieve is *~2Kb* !!\n* Alpha tween with visibility test is included in the basic package. Well it&#x27;s just a boolean check :)\n\nh2. v1.1 \"\":#v1.1 \n\np. First official version. v1.0 is a gold version :).\n\nh3. Features \"\":#Features \n\n*  *Ridiculous amount of Kb increase: Just 1.2Kb!* \n* numeric properties tweening.\n* &#x27;color&#x27;.\n\n* Using ColorTransform.\n\n* &#x27;alpha&#x27; with visibility control (negative alpha sets visible=false).\n* &#x27;frame&#x27; tweening.\n* &#x27;scale&#x27; tween.\n* Both scaleX and Y at the same time.\n\n* 21 easing functions + All Robert Penner&#x27;s classic functions.\n* Tween pause,unpause,cancel control.\n* Operation pointed by the target and its properties.\n\n* Tween overlap control.\n* A starting tween checks for older tweens of same property and cancel them).\n\nh1. 2) MotionPack \"\":#2) \n\np. Package of classes,events and interfaces that allows the developer not only to do the common tweening tasks (with the BaseTween class), but also develop its own tweening classes. It uses a Interface system that allow easy implementation and do not use the only\"slot\"of the\"extends\"keyword :).\n\nh1. Easing Functions Expansion \"\":#Easing_Functions_Expansion \n\np. Within the\"org.thelab.motion.transition\"package are the most common transitions used in tweens, and also the well known Robert Penner&#x27;s transition functions.\n\np. But one can also implement its own tween functions.\n\np. Both tween engines uses default functions for it. The template for them is:\n\nfunction ease_name(r:Number):Number;p. Where the\"r\"parameter is a Number inside 0.0 ->1.0 range. Where 0.0 is the tween start and 1.0 is the tween end. The result of this function is used in the following equation:\n\ntarget[property] = initial_value + (delta_value)*ease_name(r);p. \n\n",

   "p.

Basic syntax and events \"\":#Basic_syntax_and_events \n\np.  *Note to FlashDevelop users:* update to 3.0.6 RTM for code completion to work with eaze.\n\np. Basic tweening is classic:\n\neaze(target).to(duration, { x:dx, y:dy }); eaze(target).from(duration, { x:dx, y:dy }); eaze(target).apply({ x:dx, y:dy }); // set values immediately eaze(target).play(\"label\"); // see timeline tweening below eaze(target).to(duration, { width:dw }, false /*don&#x27;t overwrite existing tweens*/);p. Original, completion-friendly, event system:\n\neaze(target).to(duration, { x:dx, y:dy }) .onUpdate(handler, param1, etc) .onComplete(handler, param1, param2, etc); // identical to: TweenMax.to(target, duration { x:dx, y:dy, onUpdate:handler, onUpdateParams:[param1, etc], onComplete:handler, onCompleteParams:[param1, param2, etc] });p. And to set the easing function (optimized Robert Penner functions):\n\neaze(target).to(duration, { x:dx, y:dy }) .easing(Cubic.easeInOut); // default function is Quadratic.easeOuth2. Tween chaining and delaying \"\":#Tween_chaining_and_delaying \n\np. Tweens can be chained (chained tweens are started at the end of parent tween):\n\neaze(target) .from(duration, { x:dx, y:dy }) .to(duration, { x:dx, y:dy }) .play(\"over\") .chain(otherTarget).to(duration, { x:dx, y:dy }) .apply({ x:dx, y:dy }); // tweens will be executed one by onep. A delay is\"just\"a blank tween:\n\neaze(target).delay(1).onComplete(handler, arg1); // identical to TweenMax.delayedCall(1, handler, [arg1]); // and also BTW setTimeout(handler, 1000, arg1);p. Now you can chain a tween to the delay tween:\n\neaze(target).delay(1) .to(duration, { x:dx, y:dy }); // identical to: TweenMax.to(target, duration, { delay:1, x:dx, y:dy });p. Unlike with TweenMax.from(), if a tween is delayed the target will NOT be updated before the delay has expired. But you can call .updateNow() to replicate this useful behavior:\n\neaze(target).delay(1) .from(duration, { x:dx }) .updateNow(); // update target immediately // identical to: TweenMax.from(target, duration, { delay:1, x:dx });h2. Special properties \"\":#Special_properties \n\np. Automatic relation between alpha&visible:\n\neaze(target).to(duration, { alpha:0 }); // set visible to false when alpha==0 eaze(target).to(duration, { alphaVisible:0 }); // do not change visibility // identical to TweenMax.to(target, duration { autoAlpha:0 }); TweenMax.to(target, duration { alpha:0 });p. Original tint mixing:\n\neaze(target).to(1).tint(0xffffff); eaze(target).to(1).tint(0xffffff, colorize, multiply); // colorize[0..1]: color offset ratio (tint strength) // multiply[0..2]: original color multiplicator (keep original color) // remove tint eaze(target).to(1).tint(); // but you can also use a more classic syntax: eaze(target).to(1, { tint:0xffffff }); eaze(target).to(1, { tint:[0xffffff, colorize, multiply] }); eaze(target).to(1, { tint:null }); // remove tintp. Original filter syntax:\n\neaze(target).to(duration) .filter(BlurFilter, { blurX:5, blurY:5, quality:2 }); eaze(target).to(duration) .filter(GlowFilter, { blurX:20, blurY:20, color:0x00ccff, knockout:true }); // but you can also use a more classic syntax: eaze(target).to(duration, { blurFilter:{ blurX:5, blurY:5 }p. Smart color transforms tweening:\n\n// .colorMatrix(brightness[-1..1], contrast[-1..1], saturation[-1..1], // hue[-180..180], tint[RGB], colorize[0..1]) eaze(target).to(duration) .colorMatrix(0.2, 0, -1); // brightness, contrast, saturation, etc. // remove transformation eaze(target).to(duration).colorMatrix(); // or using standard filter tween syntax eaze(target).to(duration) .filter(ColorMatrixFilter, { brightness:0.2, saturation:-1 }); }); // filter built using Quasimondo&#x27;s (stripped-down) ColorMatrix classp. Classic volume syntax:\n\neaze(target).to(duration, { volume:0.5 });p. Original Bezier tween syntax:\n\n// Bezier tween to end value with one or more control points eaze(target).to(duration, { x:[100, 150] }); eaze(target).to(duration, { x:[100, 120, 150] }); // Bezier\"through\"tween to end value with one or more points to cross eaze(target).to(duration, { x:[[100, 150]] }); eaze(target).to(duration, { x:[[100, 120, 150]] }); // respectively identical to TweenMax.to(target, duration, { bezier:[{x:100}, {x:150}] }); TweenMax.to(target, duration, { bezier:[{x:100}, {x:120}, {x:150}] }); // and TweenMax.to(target, duration, { bezierThrough:[{x:100}, {x:150}] }); TweenMax.to(target, duration, { bezierThrough:[{x:100}, {x:120}, {x:150}] });p. Original\"short rotation\"syntax\n\n// works with any property eaze(target).to(1).short(\"rotation\", 160); eaze(target).to(1).short(\"angle\", Math.PI/4, true /*use radian*/);p. Built-in\"scale\"(scaleX/scaleY) tweening:\n\neaze(target).to(duration, { scale:0.5 });p. Of course all these special tweening properties work backward using eaze(target).from().\n\nh2. Timeline frame tweening \"\":#Timeline_frame_tweening \n\np. Original frame tweening options:\n\n// tween clip timeline at appropriate linear speed eaze(target).play(); // totalFrames eaze(target).play(12); eaze(target).play(\"label\"); eaze(target).play(\"start+end\"); // from label\"start\"to label\"start+end\"eaze(target).play(\"start>end\"); // from label\"start\"to label\"end\"// but you can also use a more classic syntax: eaze(target).to(duration, { frame:\"label\"});h2.

Advanced Features \"\":#Advanced_Features \n\np. For advanced animations, you can also tween function calls instead of properties\n\nActuate.update (customResize, 1, [100, 100], [300, 300]);p. Actuate also includes shortcuts for some special types of animation. Here is how you might apply a 50% tint using a color transform\n\nActuate.transform (MySprite, 1).color (0xFF0000, 0.5);p. You can also control the volume and pan of a sound transform as well\n\nActuate.transform (MySprite, 1).sound (0.5, 1); Actuate.transform (MySoundChannel, 1).sound (0.5, 1);p. You can also tween filters. You can reference the filter by its class, or by the value of its index in the filter array, whichever is easier\n\nActuate.effects (MySprite, 1).filter (BlurFilter, { blurX: 10, blurY: 10 } );p. You even can create bezier curves, and complete motion paths, like in the Flash IDE. Chain multiple path commands together to create one solid path you can tween your objects across using the MotionPathActuator\n\nvar xPath:MotionPath = MotionPath.bezier (200, 20).line (400); var yPath:MotionPath = MotionPath.bezier (0, 300).line (0); Actuate.motionPath (MySprite, 1, { x: xPath, y: yPath } );h2. Tween Modifiers \"\":#Tween_Modifiers \n\np. Each tween Actuate creates can be modified with many different tween modifiers. You can link tween modifiers to add delay, complete handlers, or configure many different options about the way your tween behaves\n\np.  *autoVisible* \n\nActuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).autoVisible (false);p. Changing the visible property results in better performance than only an alpha of zero, so the autoVisible modifier toggles the visible property automatically based upon the alpha value of the target. It is enabled by default, but it can be disabled if you choose\n\np.  *delay* \n\nActuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).delay (1);p. Controls how many seconds should pass before your animation begins\n\np.  *ease* \n\nActuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).ease (Quad.easeOut);p. Defines a custom easing equation for your animation. Actuate includes many popular easing functions in both standard and optimized formats. The default is Expo.easeOut, but you can change the default equation through Actuate.defaultEase\n\np.  *onComplete* \n\nActuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).onComplete (trace,\"Tween finished\");p. Calls a function when the tween is finished. You can also define parameters to be used when calling the function\n\np.  *onUpdate* \n\nActuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).onUpdate (trace,\"Tween updated\");p. Calls a function every time the tween updates. You can also define parameters to be used when calling the function\n\np.  *reflect* \n\nActuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).repeat ().reflect ();p. Automatically reverses the animation every other time it is repeated. You must enable repeat in order to see any effect\n\np.  *repeat* \n\nActuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).repeat (10);p. Runs your animation multiple times before it finishes. You can make your tween repeat indefinitely by passing no value, or you can define the number of times it should repeat\n\np.  *reverse* \n\nActuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).reverse ();p. Reverses the direction of your tween\n\np.  *smartRotation* \n\nActuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { rotation: 180 } ).smartRotation ();p. Rotation is circular, so it can be strange to animate. What should be positive one moment is negative the next. As a result, treating rotation like a standard tween will result in jerking once the signs change. Smart rotation always applies rotation in the nearest direction, alleviating this issue.\n\np.  *snapping* \n\nActuate.tween (MySprite, 1, { alpha: 1 } ).snapping ();p. Rounds all of your tween values\n\n",

Features:\n\n* Connection pooling.\n* Unified interface for different loading types.\n* Unified progress notification.\n* Events for individual items and as groups.\n* Priority\n* Stop and resuming individually as well as in bulk.\n* Cache management.\n* Statistics about loading (latency, speed, average speed).\n* Various kinds on progress indication: ratio (items loaded / items to load), bytes , and weighted percentage.\n* Configurable number of retries.\n* Configurable logging.\n* Various assest types (XML, NetStreams, Swfs, Images, Sound, Text Files)\n\np. Design goals:\n\n* Minimal imports.\n* Few method to learn.\n* Consistent interface, regardless of content type.\n\np. BulkLoader gracefully handles progress notification in these use cases:\n\n* Few connections to open: bytes total can be used instantly.\n* Many connections opened: progress by ratio\n* Many connections opened for data of widely varying sizes: progress by weight.\n\n",

AS-HIVE allows developers to rapidly build applications and games that rely on state, event, and load management of external media files.\n\np. We&#x27;d like to foster a collective of creative people who design and develop primarily using Adobe&#x27;s Flash. We encourage input and participation from all ranges of people who code in Actionscript.\n\np. Hard core developers may be interested to know that AS-HIVE is built on a state-based MVC framework but you don&#x27;t have to be a hard core developer to use it.\n\np. Intermediate developers who don&#x27;t wish to advance the framework can try the samples so that one can see how to save time and energy allowing AS-HIVE to handle loading your external assets like xml, pngs, flvs and mp3s. AS-HIVE also helps you animate screens by creating sequences that build up and tear down before moving to the next state.\n\np. By integrating other open source projects like Tweener and Papervision3D, AS-HIVE offers a robust and reliable mechanism for manipulating 2D and 3D content allowing the developer to focus on architecture and flow.\n\np.  *How do I learn about AS-HIVE?* \n\np.

   "p.  !http://www.jeffdepascale.com/images/fosfrLogo.jpg! \n\np. UPDATED 09.23.09: Currently releasing Fosfr .9 nightly builds, these are growing very stable and .9 is a few days of stability testing away now. Fosfr .8 is still available in the downloads section for now, a new example site built on .9 will be built once .9 is final. See the wiki doc \"fosfrNightlyBuilds\":/p/fosfr/wiki/fosfrNightlyBuilds for limited info on where to begin with implementing this preview release. Preliminary documentation (still in the works) is available at: \"http://www.jeffdepascale.com/documentation/fosfrPreRelease/\":http://www.jeffdepascale.com/documentation/fosfrPreRelease/ \n\np. Info on .9: See \"nextRelease\":/p/fosfr/wiki/nextRelease doc in wiki. Pushing towards a final 1.0 release, and the change list is long and growing, but the vast majority is tied to overhauling existing functionality to make the framework more digestable and all around useful and adding the last pieces of wish list functionalities before locking down to bug fixes, which will begin after this release through 1.0.\n\np. Some of the bigger featues of .9 BETA (anticipated final release by 11/15):\n\np. -Fosfr is now implemented using the provided SWC files and the included SWF library file (the com folder is still provided for reference). see the guide \"SWCImplementationGuide\":/p/fosfr/wiki/SWCImplementationGuide for information. This reduces the framework footprint to 13kb on initial load, a library load of 27kb (pulled automatically in the initial preload), and 4kb for all other framework files. This means substantially reduced load times, much faster compile times (since SWC files are precompiled into bytecode) and initial preloader graphics appear very quickly with only 13kb of overhead on initial load.\n\np. The Notifier panel as of Fosfr .9 build 120 (showing optional extended information):\n !http://www.jeffdepascale.com/images/notifierGrab.jpg! \n\np. -Notifier (formerly debug) - Error trapping, variable panel size, ability to prioritize debug messaging, player info, garbage collection forcing (debug layers only), real time property inspectors, and an optional visual error beacon for trapped errors.\n\np. -Notifier additionally now features a code injection system; see \"codeInjection\":/p/fosfr/wiki/codeInjection for details on valid expressions. Adding functionality to this on an ongoing basis right now.\n\np. -A new sound controller\n\np. -overhaul of loader event notifications\n\np. -overhaul of how external classes are handled in the framework; much tighter integration all around.\n\np. -utilization of a custom namespace to close some of the open holes in the framework.\n\np. Check out the \"nextRelease\":/p/fosfr/wiki/nextRelease doc in the wiki for the full revision list.\n\np. NOTE - .8 beta was released with an outdated version of swfaddress. please download the latest version at: \"http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/\":http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/ This will be addressed in the .9 release.\n\np. Updated 5.18.09 - Current release: .8 BETA\n\np. A complete framework for AS3 site development, Fosfr simplies building full sites designed with a master SWF and multiple sub SWF format. Fosfr handles debugging, tracking, setting up site navigation, loading and unloading sub pages, automatic preloading (via Prequel), SWFAddress handling, simple access to Flashvars, query string params, and cookies, and does it all from implementations as simple as two lines of code per document class. Comes with a complete set of base classes for simple access to all of the methods and features of Fosfr right at Document class level, and optionally can run from a single configuration xml file for ease of access to site parameters without the need to recompile. FosfrLite (included), a streamlined version of Fosfr, provides access to the various pieces of Fosfr without the navigation package for loading sub SWF&#x27;s.\n\np. The current release of Fosfr is packaged with SWFAddress 2.2 ( \"http://www.asual.com/swfaddress\":http://www.asual.com/swfaddress ) and Prequel 1.0 ( \"http://code.google.com/p/prequel-preloader\":http://code.google.com/p/prequel-preloader )\n\np.

Flash Camo (for short) is a graphics framework that allows AS 3 applications to be easily skinned from pngs, jpgs, or gifs. The framework is broken down into 3 core areas: Decals, the CSS Parser, and the \"CamoDisplay\":/p/flash-camouflage/wiki/CamoDisplay . These systems can be used individually or combined to fit your needs. When used together they form a powerful set of tools to help skin and style any Flash application. With Camo\342\200\231s modular approach, you can use as little or as much of the framework as you want. The entire framework is under 35k.\n\np. Flash Camo is open source (under the MIT License), is compatible with FlashPlayer 9/10, Flex 3, and AIR. It can be built with the open source Flex SKD compiler or used in Flash CS 3/4 as a swc.\n\np.  *I have created a new Google Group to help answer questions about the framework and start open discussions on tips, tricks, and problems.

   "p.  !http://sweatshop.somerandomdude.com/projects/coordy/images/coordy_300w.png! \n\np.  *Coordy is a light Actionscript 3 layout framework which offers a simple way to organize DisplayObjects into various different 2d and 3d layouts. The layouts are light, powerful and virtual organizers that simply manage x/y/z coordinates of DisplayObjects - meaning your objects are not tightly bound to any specific layout.* \n\nh3. Update (December 1, 2009) \"\":#Update_(December_1,_2009) \n\np. coordy 0.9.9 is officially released. All sorts of changes have been made which could potentially cause problems with any code using 0.9.1 or lower. I will be writing up some documentation on changes in the latest version, until then, you can check out all the fun new stuff \"here\":http://somerandomdude.com/projects/coordy/ .\n\nh3. Update (November 15, 2009) \"\":#Update_(November_15,_2009) \n\np. coordy just went through a *huge* rewrite and is quite different in many ways. I have updated the source in SVN, but the ZIP download still offers up the 0.9.1 version. The examples and documentation have been updated in the SVN repo if you want to give it a try. I will be posting extensive notes on the changes and how to best use the library in the days to come.\n\nh3. Update (August 20, 2009) \"\":#Update_(August_20,_2009) \n\np. coordy 0.9.1 was just committed and available to use. Layouts in coordy 0.9.1 now have the ability to export their layout properties as either a JSON string or an XML object. Have a look at the \"documentation\":http://sweatshop.somerandomdude.com/projects/coordy/docs for more details.\n\nh1. Support This Project \"\":#Support_This_Project \n\np. coordy is completely free to use and will always be that way. That said, this code takes time to write and test. Please \" *support this project* \":https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=8307931 by giving whatever you feel is appropriate - it will help ease the burden of continuing to push this project forward.\n\nh1. Getting Started \"\":#Getting_Started \n\np. Get to know this framework by checking out some \"examples\":http://sweatshop.somerandomdude.com/projects/coordy/examples.html and the library&#x27;s \"documentation\":http://sweatshop.somerandomdude.com/projects/coordy/docs/ . The examples provided give a sense of the basic mechanisms and process for setting up layouts, updating layouts and managing multiple layouts. *Source code to the examples are also available on the examples page* . I suggest checking out the \"source via SVN\":http://coordy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ as that will be updated much more frequently than the static zip.\n\nh1. How Does It Work? \"\":#How_Does_It_Work? \n\np. The basic explanation of how coordy works is once a DisplayObject is added to a layout, a node instance is created which points to the DisplayObject. The node is the link between the layout and DisplayObject. The node contains all the coordinate information for that DisplayObject, so that even if a DisplayObject is moved, the coordinate information for it persists due to its corresponding node. This is why the DisplayObject can belong to an infinite amount of layouts, because the layout merely handles its created node objects which, in turn, have a link to the DisplayObject.\n\np. Layouts are merely abstract organizers, they do not need to be added/removed from the stage.

   "p. Allows you to slice an FLV at runtime in AS3. Slices can also be merged into a single FLV file.\n\np. FLVSlicer can also extract sound or video only from an FLV.\n\np. AS3 Code Sample :\n\n//create the FLVSlice object var slicer:FLVSlicer = new FLVSlicer(new flvBytes()); // listen for the SlicedEvent.COMPLETE event slicer.addEventListener( SlicedEvent.COMPLETE, onSliced ); // extract the slice with the specific timing (in ms) and save it var firstSlice:FLVSlice = slicer.slice(1000, 3000); // extract another slice with the specific timing (in ms) and save it var secondSlice:FLVSlice = slicer.slice(7200, 8900); // create a FLVSlice vector var slices:Vector.<FLVSlice>= new Vector.<FLVSlice>(); // store the slices slices.push ( firstSlice ); slices.push ( secondSlice ); // merge them as a single FLV stream var merged:FLVSlice = slicer.merge( slices );",
